# **COMMAND SYSTEM**
Using the principles of von Neumann, a proprietary educational computer was designed, a system of commands was designed and implemented, which allows input and output of data, performing various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and finding remainders from division), as well as other commands for transferring data from one cell to another, etc. All commands are executed sequentially, except for unconditional and conditional transitions, which can change the standard flow of the program. Their work will be described below. Each command has two operands (addresses) that it can control. For arithmetic commands, the calculation result is written in the line with the address A1. The memory of the learning machine consists of 512 lines with addresses from 1 to 512.

Below is a table of implemented commands, their number (some numbers are not commands, so they do not have a mnemonic equivalent - they are marked with three question marks - ???) and a brief description:

# **REGISTERS AND FLAGS**
Registers are the operands used to execute the current instruction. Registers are divided into the following types according to their logical perception: RK, R1, R2, RA. RK is a register that represents the current command; RA is the address number of the current line; R1 and R2 are the operands on which the instruction is executed.

The flag ùúî ("omega"), which changes depending on the result of the operations of addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, is used for conditional transition Yes, its value will be 0 if the result of the operation is zero. If the result of the operation is less than zero, the flag will be set to the value 1, if the result is greater than zero, it will have the value 2. It is used to implement the conditional transition operation.

The S flag is the result sign flag.

Flag C is the flag of the sign of the transfer from the higher order.

The T flag is a turn-by-turn mode flag.

The Z flag is a zero-result flag used to implement a conditional transition operation.

The Err flag is an error flag. It signals the occurrence of an error during the execution of the program. By default, it has a value of 0, which means no errors, but when an error occurs, it changes to 1 and the program crashes.

All registers and flags have been moved to the GUI form panel, so that you can get complete information about the current command and its operands while running the machine in debug mode.

# **IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATIONAL** **MACHINE**
**TOOLS**

The emulator of the two-address learning machine was implemented using the C# programming language and using the framework for building applications with a graphical user interface for the platforms of the Windows family of operating systems, which is called the Microsoft WPF .Net Framework. The project was implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 integrated development environment.

**GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE**

For the convenience of using the educational machine, a graphical user interface was created. Data is entered using the keyboard, and the emulator is controlled using the mouse. Below is a screenshot of the window, which is the main window with which the user interacts. Numbers from 1 to 6 indicate the interface elements, the functioning and purpose of which is described below.

***Picture 1**. Graphical user interface*


List and description of interface elements marked in Picture 1:

1. Table with program code. Here, the user can enter and edit program commands for further use. The user is allowed to enter both integers and real numbers. If the user enters incorrect data, when starting the program, a corresponding error will be displayed in the diagnostics window.
2. During the operation of the program, with the help of the corresponding commands specified by the user in the code table, the program can ask the user to enter data (integer or real number). To do this, a window will appear in which you will need to enter a number using the keyboard. If you enter an incorrect value or cancel the input operation, the program will display a corresponding error in the diagnostics window. If the entered value is correct, the program will continue its work, and the entered number will appear in the "Input" window. Thus, the user can remember what data he entered in the program.
3. The result of the program can be an integer or a real number. To display this information, you need to give the training machine one of the appropriate commands, and the number itself will be displayed in the "Output" window.
4. In the interface there is a panel of registers and flags that change during the execution of the program. In step-by-step mode, this panel clearly demonstrates the program execution process.
5. During the execution of the program in the learning machine, some warnings and remarks or unexpected situations may occur. In this case, all messages generated by the program will be displayed in the "Diagnostics" window.
6. The panel displays the path to the open file.
7. At the top of the window there are auxiliary and control buttons: "Save", "Save as", "Open", "Help" and "Cleaning"; "Run" - run the program without debugging, "Start debugging" - start a step-by-step program run, "Step" - go to the next command, "Finish debugging" - end a step-by-step program run.
